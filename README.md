## Overview
I'm working through a class on data structures using a college syllabus (I'm trying not to post too much info in case any current students stumble upon this!). My goal is to learn how these data structures work and how/when they can be used.

#### Data Structures
* ArrayLists
* Linked Structures, especially singly and doubly linked lists
* Stacks
* Queues
* Binary search trees
* AVL trees
* Heaps and priority queues
* Hashing, hash tables, and hash maps
* Tries
* Graphs

#### Algorithms
* Big-Oh notation (upper bounds and lower bounds)
* Algorithm analysis
* BubbleSort, SelectionSort, InsertionSort
* MergeSort, QuickSort, HeapSort
* Insert, Search, and Remove algorithms for each data structure
* Shortest path algorithms for a directed graph
* Topological Sort for a directed graph
* Minimum Spanning Tree for an undirected graph
* Disjoint sets

There are many ways to practice computer science fundamentals online (LeetCode, HackerRank, Cracking the Coding Interview)-- but I figured that it would also be helpful for me to learn data structure fundamentals in a purposefully structured format.

## Projects

### Lab 1: Java Java

#### Goals
* Practice working with Java
* Learn command line arguments
* Practice using arrays
* Use Scanner to handle input from users and files

### Lab 2: Making My Own ArrayList

#### Goals
* Learn about Java Collections Framework
* Create a class using Generics
* Use an Abstract class to jumpstart implementation
* Practice using JUnit for proper testing

### Lab 3: Navigating Mazes with Stacks and Queues!

#### Goals
* Implement a Stack and a Queue
* Build a simple linked list of nodes
* Use your Stack and Queue to solve a maze
* Compare differences between two solution strategies

### Lab 4: Linked Lists!

#### Goals
* Implement a doubly linked list
* Build an iterator
* Explore difference in running time between different data orderings
