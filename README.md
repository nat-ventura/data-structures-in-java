I'm working through this CSCI 151 Data Structures syllabus posted on the Oberlin College Computer Science department page. My goal is to learn how these data structures work and how/when they can be used.

## Data Structures
* ArrayLists
* Linked Structures, especially singly and doubly linked lists
* Stacks
* Queues
* Binary search trees
* AVL trees
* Heaps and priority queues
* Hashing, hash tables, and hash maps
* Tries
* Graphs

## Algorithms
* Big-Oh notation (upper bounds and lower bounds)
* Algorithm analysis
* BubbleSort, SelectionSort, InsertionSort
* MergeSort, QuickSort, HeapSort
* Insert, Search, and Remove algorithms for each data structure
* Shortest path algorithms for a directed graph
* Topological Sort for a directed graph
* Minimum Spanning Tree for an undirected graph
* Disjoint sets

I know there are many ways to practice computer science fundamentals online (LeetCode, HackerRank, Cracking the Coding Interview)-- but I figured that in addition to daily exercises, it would be helpful for me to learn data structure fundamentals in a purposefully structured format.

I thought this would also be a great opportunity to get more comfortable with Java. This course is meant to pick up where the previous course (Intro to Computer Science) left off, while also transitioning future computer science majors from Python to Java.
