# Data Structures in Java

I'm working through a class on data structures using a college syllabus (I'm trying not to post too much info in case any current students stumble upon this!). My goal is to learn how these data structures work and how/when they can be used.

## Table of Contents
* [Major Concepts](#major-concepts)
* [Lab 1 - Java Java](#lab-1-java-java)
* [Lab 2 - Making My Own ArrayList](#lab-2-making-my-own-arraylist)
* [Lab 3 - Navigating Mazes with Stacks and Queues!](#lab-3-navigating-mazes-with-stacks-and-queues)
* [Lab 4 - Linked Lists!](#lab-4-linked-lists)

## Major Concepts

Many exercises in computer science fundamentals are available online (LeetCode, HackerRank, Cracking the Coding Interview, etc.)-- but I figured that it would also be helpful for me to learn data structure fundamentals in a purposefully structured format.

#### Data Structures
* ArrayLists
* Linked Structures, especially singly and doubly linked lists
* Stacks
* Queues
* Binary search trees
* AVL trees
* Heaps and priority queues
* Hashing, hash tables, and hash maps
* Tries
* Graphs

#### Algorithms
* Big-Oh notation (upper bounds and lower bounds)
* Algorithm analysis
* BubbleSort, SelectionSort, InsertionSort
* MergeSort, QuickSort, HeapSort
* Insert, Search, and Remove algorithms for each data structure
* Shortest path algorithms for a directed graph
* Topological Sort for a directed graph
* Minimum Spanning Tree for an undirected graph
* Disjoint sets

## Projects

## Lab 1: Java Java

This lab was mostly reviewing concepts learned in Python and getting more familiar with Java.

The practice included printing a pyramid of stars to the console (classic), writing a High-Low numeric guessing game, writing a program that redacts certain words from documents, and creating a Benford analysis of numbers in a given file of numbers.

#### Goals
* Practice working with Java
* Learn command line arguments
* Practice using arrays
* Use Scanner to handle input from users and files

## Lab 2: Making My Own ArrayList

The goal was to write "my own ArrayList" class, or MyArrayList to better understand everything Java's built-in ArrayList class. I also wrote a series of test to make sure that MyArrayList behaved the same as the given ArrayList.

#### Goals
* Learn about Java Collections Framework
* Create a class using Generics
* Use an Abstract class to jumpstart implementation
* Practice using JUnit for proper testing

## Lab 3: Navigating Mazes with Stacks and Queues!

Created a MyStack and MyQueue class, then a class to solve text-based mazes using either the stack or queue data structure to move through the maze-- marking walls, the edges of the maze, and the start and finish. The end result is viewable in a provided GUI interface, as your "team of explorers" moves through given text-based mazes according to the queue structure or stack structure.

#### Goals
* Implement a Stack and a Queue
* Build a simple linked list of nodes
* Use your Stack and Queue to solve a maze
* Compare differences between two solution strategies

## Lab 4: Linked Lists!

Writes a doubly linked list class and an iterator.

#### Goals
* Implement a doubly linked list
* Build an iterator
* Explore difference in running time between different data orderings
