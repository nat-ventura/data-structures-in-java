# Data Structures in Java

I'm working through a class on data structures using a college syllabus (I'm trying not to post too much info about the particular course in case any current students stumble upon this!). My goal is to learn how these data structures work and how/when they can be used. I'm working with Java in Eclipse.

* [Lab 3 - Navigating Mazes with Stacks and Queues!](#lab-3---navigating-mazes-with-stacks-and-queues)
* [Lab 4 - Linked Lists!](#lab-4---linked-lists)

## Major Concepts

Many exercises in computer science fundamentals are available online (LeetCode, HackerRank, Cracking the Coding Interview, etc.)-- but I figured that it would also be helpful for me to learn data structure fundamentals in a purposefully structured format.

#### Data Structures
* ArrayLists
* Linked Structures, especially singly and doubly linked lists
* Stacks
* Queues
* Binary search trees
* AVL trees
* Heaps and priority queues
* Hashing, hash tables, and hash maps
* Tries
* Graphs

#### Algorithms
* Big-Oh notation (upper bounds and lower bounds)
* Algorithm analysis
* BubbleSort, SelectionSort, InsertionSort
* MergeSort, QuickSort, HeapSort
* Insert, Search, and Remove algorithms for each data structure
* Shortest path algorithms for a directed graph
* Topological Sort for a directed graph
* Minimum Spanning Tree for an undirected graph
* Disjoint sets

## Lab 1 - Reviewing Fundamentals

This lab was mostly reviewing concepts learned in Python and getting more familiar with Java.

The practice included printing a pyramid of stars to the console (classic), writing a High-Low numeric guessing game, writing a program that redacts certain words from documents, and creating a Benford analysis of numbers in a given file of numbers.

#### Goals
* Practice working with Java
* Learn command line arguments
* Practice using arrays
* Use Scanner to handle input from users and files

## Lab 2 - Making My Own ArrayList

The goal was to write "my own ArrayList" class, or MyArrayList to better understand everything Java's built-in ArrayList class. I also wrote a series of test to make sure that MyArrayList behaved the same as the given ArrayList.

#### Goals
* Learn about Java Collections Framework
* Create a class using Generics
* Use an Abstract class to jumpstart implementation
* Practice using JUnit for proper testing

## Lab 3 - Navigating Mazes with Stacks and Queues!

Created a MyStack and MyQueue class, then a class to solve text-based mazes using either the stack or queue data structure to move through the maze-- marking walls, the edges of the maze, and the start and finish. The end result is viewable in a provided GUI interface, as your "team of explorers" moves through given text-based mazes according to the queue structure or stack structure.

#### Goals
* Implement a Stack and a Queue
* Build a simple linked list of nodes
* Use your Stack and Queue to solve a maze
* Compare differences between two solution strategies

## Lab 4 - Linked Lists!

Writes a doubly linked list class and an iterator.

#### Goals
* Implement a doubly linked list
* Build an iterator
* Explore difference in running time between different data orderings
