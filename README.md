I'm working through this CSCI 151 Data Structures syllabus posted on Oberlin College Computer Science department page.



I know there are many ways to practice computer science fundamentals online (LeetCode, HackerRank, Cracking the Coding Interview)-- but I figured that in addition to daily exercises, it would be a good idea for me to learn data structure fundamentals in a structured format.

This would also be a good opportunity to learn Java where the syllabus specifically assumes prior experience with Python programming.
