North Coast Toast of the Town

   by Maddie Stocker, News Editor

   Sept. 5, 2013

   A locally owned food truck is taking root in Oberlin this semester,
   providing both college and community members with a quick and easy way
   to grab their meals on the go. The truck, which currently totes the
   catchy slogan "North Coast Toast," is owned and operated by College
   third-years Casey Silverstein, Jeremy Reimnitz and Evan Zierk. Owner
   Casey Silverstein hopes that the truck's three future locations, which
   can be found on their website, will succeed in targeting popular areas
   of campus, enhancing the quantity of late-night snacking. "We want to
   work with the community to see what they want to eat and will be always
   taking suggestions for our monthly specials," says Silverstein. "[We]
   hope gain to customer base in Oberlin that could function as a
   community or family. I really only want to serve what the community
   wants to eat. With that said I would love to see North Coast Toast
   function as an example of consumers demanding from a business exactly
   what they want; hopefully local and delicious food." Aside from being
   "gooey," "spicy" and "savory," North Coast Toast's grilled cheeses will
   also be made from local ingredients. "I like the idea of North Coast
   Toast being able provide business to local food vendors while also
   serving a product that is farm-to-table and delicious," said
   Silverstein. "[In order to do this,] we contacted various food
   distributors including, but not limited to, Minerva Dairy and City
   Fresh." Although they may have loftier ambitions--working with the town
   to develop laws that would allow food trucks to acquire permits from
   Oberlin--their current goal is simple. "North Coast Toast thinks
   Oberlin College and Community members work hard and they deserve a
   unique lunch and late-night option," said Silverstein. "We want to
   [provide] the community with more food options-- especially ones that
   are quick and cheap."
